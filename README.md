# Hi there 👋

![Data Center Vibes](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aD2saalBwwftBIY/giphy.gif)

I'm someone who finds joy in blinking LEDs, humming server racks, and well-organized cable management.  
🏢 I work in a data center — yes, it’s cold, loud, and honestly kind of awesome.  
🔌 From networking configs to scripting automation, I like making systems work smoothly behind the scenes.  
📦 I tinker with hardware, code, and everything in between.  
🚀 Always learning, always optimizing.  
☕ Strong opinions on cable labels and coffee.
